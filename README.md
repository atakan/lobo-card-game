# Lobo

An implementation of the solo card game *Lobo*, designed by James Ernest.
See: [The video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VujE1WR_Q8k) and the links therein, for rules.


This is now working, but you need to enter the input as a Lisp list, so a bit hard to play. However, all the functionality is (supposed to be) implemented.
